# Tk2Voice

Tk2Voice is a simple graphical application using Tkinter and pyttsx3 for text-to-speech (TTS) conversion.

## Installation

Make sure you have Python installed on your system. Then, install the required libraries:

```bash
pip install pyttsx3
pip install threading
```
## Usage
Clone this repository or copy the source code into a file named main.py.

## Features
Text Input: You can enter text in the text field.
Text-to-Speech Conversion: Click the "Start TTS!" button to convert the text to speech.
Quit Application: Click the "Quit" button to close the application.

## Notes
Ensure that the tkinter and pyttsx3 libraries are correctly installed.
The script uses os._exit(0) to quit the application, which immediately closes the application.
